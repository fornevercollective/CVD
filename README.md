Mimics natural conditions in Earth's mantle.

Seed placed in carbon, subjected to ~5–6 GPa and 1300–1600°C.

Grows diamond via carbon recrystallization.

Suitable for both gem-quality and industrial diamonds.

2. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)

Preferred for modern lab diamonds.

Uses methane and hydrogen gases in a vacuum.

Plasma breaks down gases; carbon deposits on diamond seed.

Controlled, scalable, ideal for electronics and jewelry.

PART 2: Diamonds for Battery Production

Key Types

1. Doped CVD Diamonds

Boron-doped: conductive, used in high-voltage electronics.

NV centers: quantum sensors.

2. Nuclear Diamond Batteries

Radioactive C-14 in CVD-grown diamond.

Sealed in non-radioactive diamond casing.

Ultra-long-life for low-drain devices.

PART 3: Prototype CVD System Build

Core Components

1. Vacuum Chamber
