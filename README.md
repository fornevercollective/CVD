Lab-Grown Diamond Production: CVD Prototype Guide

PART 1: Lab-Grown Diamonds for Jewelry and Industry

Main Methods

1. High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT)

Mimics natural conditions in Earth's mantle.

Seed placed in carbon, subjected to ~5–6 GPa and 1300–1600°C.

Grows diamond via carbon recrystallization.

Suitable for both gem-quality and industrial diamonds.

2. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)

Preferred for modern lab diamonds.

Uses methane and hydrogen gases in a vacuum.

Plasma breaks down gases; carbon deposits on diamond seed.

Controlled, scalable, ideal for electronics and jewelry.

PART 2: Diamonds for Battery Production

Key Types

1. Doped CVD Diamonds

Boron-doped: conductive, used in high-voltage electronics.

NV centers: quantum sensors.

2. Nuclear Diamond Batteries

Radioactive C-14 in CVD-grown diamond.

Sealed in non-radioactive diamond casing.

Ultra-long-life for low-drain devices.

PART 3: Prototype CVD System Build

Core Components

1. Vacuum Chamber

Size: 10–30 cm ID.

Quartz or stainless steel.

Needs ports for gas, view, heating.

2. Gas Supply and Flow

Gases: CH4, H2 (+ optional dopants).

Cylinders, regulators, stainless steel lines.

Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs): MKS, Alicat.

3. Microwave or Plasma Generator

Microwave: 2.45 GHz, 600–3000 W.

Waveguide or resonant cavity.

4. Substrate Heater

Target temp: 700–1000°C.

Resistive or RF heating.

Controlled via PID.

5. Vacuum System

Rotary vane pump for base vacuum.

Optional: turbomolecular pump for cleaner runs.

Brands: Pfeiffer, Edwards, Leybold.

6. Control & Monitoring

Temp: thermocouple + PID.

Pressure: Pirani/thermocouple gauge.

Optional: plasma camera, PC control.

PART 4: Basic CVD Growth Steps

Pump chamber to base vacuum.

Heat substrate to ~800–900°C.

Flow H2 (90–99%) and CH4 (1–10%).

Ignite microwave or RF plasma.

Maintain 8–72 hours.
